scoreKeeper
===========

An app to keep track of the score at my kids' sporting events.
I built my counter app simply for practice.  A woman at my Girl Develop It coding group suggested it as an fairly simple project for a beginner. I took the counter with me on my phone to my kids soccer game, thinking I would use it to keep track of the score, but quickly realized that an app that could track the score for both teams would be far more useful, so I built that the following day.  Both apps have been fun and useful.
